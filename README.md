# Arkanosis' package repositories

This git repository contains the necessary files to populate the following package repositories:
 * [apk.arkanosis.net](https://apk.arkanosis.net) Android package repository;
 * [apt.arkanosis.net](https://apt.arkanosis.net) Debian & Kubuntu package repository;
 * [pkg.arkanosis.net](https://pkg.arkanosis.net) Arch Linux package repository.

Software authors and packagers are most of the time third parties but packages are all curated, reviewed and built by [myself](https://arkanosis.net) for my personal use.

Any package I don't use anymore may be removed at any time, *except packages of software I've written myself*. Support for distros I don't use anymore may be discontinued at any time â€” this usually means versions of Debian older than stable and versions of Kubuntu older than the latest LTS. Therefore, if you ever depend on a third-party package being available from here, update your distro and drop me an email so that I can at least tell you in advance, should I plan to retire it.

Any package made available in the official repositories of a distro (or in the official F-Droid repository, for Android) may be removed at any time, *including packages for software I've written myself*. This shouldn't cause any issue for you.
